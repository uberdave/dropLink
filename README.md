dropLink
========

Droplink is an iphone app that allows you to connect with people you do not know by thier proximity.


For, example, two users with the app could find each other within a radius of up to 20 miles and then  "air share" files.

For an overview, see "dropLink Overview" in the repo.
Current Status : beta

Will compile using ios deployment target 5.1 using IOS 6.1.  
Will locate by users on the same database by proximity.  
Will transfer files between users dropbox accounts on the fly, in the cloud- no waiting for transfers.  
dropLink uses Parse.com and Dropbox to share files
