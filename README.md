dropLink
========

Droplink is an iphone app that uses Parse.com and Dropbox to share files with other ios users bounded by a specific geograpic location.

For, example, two users with the app could find each other within a radius of up to 20 miles and then  "air share" files.

For an overview, see "dropLink Overview" in the repo.

Currently, will compile using ios deployment target 5.1 using IOS 6.1.
